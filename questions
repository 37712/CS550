for question 1 you can proof by contracdition

for quesion 2, how do we calculate the new positon once we have step size

for question 3, what is mutation and crossover methods supposed to do

is it ok to import classes from other files that we might need
for example on searchstrategies.py we imported searchrep and tileboard

what is the goal state, where is the tileboard supposed to be, middle or at a corner and what corner

goal state should be when all the blocks are in order and the blank block is int he bottom right

for manhattan distance, are we supposed to add up all of the distances each tile is away from their correct positions?
yes, we add the distance of each node all together

what does force state in npuzzle mean?
force state allows us to force a preset puzzle

for problemsearch.py, what do we need to print out when debug and vervose are true
really up to us, anything that is "usefull stuff"

other
when dequeue a node we take a look to see it is the goal if not then we put it in the explored set

never need to turn on multiple solutions





************additional info**************

Does a state contain nodes or does a node contain states?

Use expand to create children nodes

It will create a list of child nodes

State is instance of tailboard

Problem is instance of npuzzle

Check all children before checking for goal

Check if in explored before putting in frontier. Frontier organizes automatically



Will the frontier set contain nodes, actions or states?

Frontier set contains search nodes

How to calculate Manhattan distance?

Manhattan distance is adding the distance for each value in puzzle from their correct place

Debug where I am, state, g and h
