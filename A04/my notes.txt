once you have separated your subset of data
use the add method on decisiciontreesupport.py
to add a branch that contains the subset data
everytime we fork (decisitonfork) we are asking anew question

for prunning you have to compute the chi2 statistic
prunning only happens once you have reached the leaf nodes of the tree

things to ask profesor.
how do you call or link to parent when caling the next decision_tree_learning?


review:
how does information gainwork, slide 27, and how does it work when you have more than 2 values (not binary)
