once you have separated your subset of data
use the add method on decisiciontreesupport.py
to add a branch that contains the subset data
everytime we fork (decisitonfork) we are asking anew question

for prunning you have to compute the chi2 statistic
prunning only happens once you have reached the leaf nodes of the tree
